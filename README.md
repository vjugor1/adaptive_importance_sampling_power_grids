# Adaptive Importance Sampling for Power Grid Feasibility Estimation

This project implements the algorithm for computation of Gaussian volume of a polytope's complement. The approach is used for estimation of grid failure in the case of DC approximation.



## Usage

Use `Samplings' Comparison Grids.ipynb` for experiments with power grids, corresponding folders for particular experiments and data extraction.

The notebook `Samplings' Comparison Polygon.ipynb` can be used for experiments on regular polytope which is a simple test case.
